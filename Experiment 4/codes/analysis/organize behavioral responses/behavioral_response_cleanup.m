% Data clean up code for Experiment 4 of the manuscript 
% "The nature of the perceptual representation for decision making".
%
% The code imports subjects' behavioral responses and organize data.
% In the end, the code will save 'dataForModeling.mat' file in 
% '.../Experiment 4/data/subject_responses'. To avoid overwrite on the
% existing file, the line 77 is currently commented. To run this code, 
% locate current directory to where the code is saved.
